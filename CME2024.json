The clear source of this CME is an eruption starting around 2024-06-24T01Z off of or behind the SW limb and seen as an unusually long/persistant brightening off of the SW limb seen in AIA 131/335 between 2024-06-24T01Z and as opening  of field lines on/behind the SW limb in AIA 193/171 starting after 2024-06-24T01Z. The opening of field lines starts as relatively narrow but becomes wider after 2024-06-24T02Z and is followed by very high rising post-eruptive arcades seen  on/just behind the SW limb.
